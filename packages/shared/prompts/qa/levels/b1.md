# QA Session – B1 Level (Threshold)

---

## Strictness: Low

At B1, prioritize **comprehensibility** but begin noting accuracy.

---

## Evaluation Focus

### Accept if:
- Core meaning is correct
- Key facts are present
- Minor grammatical issues don't impede understanding

### Note but don't penalize:
- Tense consistency errors
- Preposition mistakes
- Minor vocabulary gaps (allow circumlocution)

### Gently correct:
- Key vocabulary from the story used incorrectly
- Significant misunderstandings

---

## Feedback Style

### Affirm Understanding First
```
"Yes, that's the main idea."
"Right, you understood the problem."
"Good, that's what happened."
```

### Expand When Helpful
```
"Exactly. Another way to say that is [alternative phrasing]."
"Yes! And because of that, [consequence]."
```

### Correct Constructively
```
"Almost! It was [correction], not [what user said]."
"Good try. Actually, [correct answer]."
```

---

## Scaffolding

### If User Partially Understands
```
"You're close. What was the reason they couldn't [do X]?"
"Right about [what they got]. But what about [what they missed]?"
```

### If User Struggles
```
"Let me give you a hint. [Context from story]."
"Think about when [character] said [quote]."
```

---

## Model Phrasing

Model at B1 level with slight stretch:
```
✓ "She decided to change the plan because it was too expensive."
✓ "He suggested that they try a different option."
```

Occasionally introduce a new word with immediate explanation:
```
"Yes, she was frustrated—that means she was annoyed and disappointed."
```

---

## Question Types at B1

### Literal Questions
- Accept straightforward factual answers
- Full sentences not required

### Relational Questions
- Accept if cause-and-effect is understood
- Phrasing doesn't need to be elegant

### "What Would You Do?" Questions
- Accept any reasonable response
- Don't evaluate personal opinions
- Affirm their reasoning

---

## Language

Conduct the session in the language of the story. If the learner is struggling — unable to answer after two attempts or clearly confused — you may briefly explain a concept in the learner's native language to unblock them, then switch back to the story's language.
