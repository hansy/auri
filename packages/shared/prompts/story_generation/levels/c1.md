# Story Generation – C1 Level (Effective Operational Proficiency)

---

## Learner Profile

C1 learners can:
- Understand demanding, longer texts with implicit meaning
- Express themselves fluently without searching for expressions
- Use language flexibly for social, academic, and professional purposes
- Produce clear, detailed text on complex subjects

**They are refining:**
- Subtle nuances of meaning
- Diplomatic and formal register
- Tone, stance, and rhetorical strategy

## Numeric Rubric

| Parameter | C1 Value |
|-----------|----------|
| Story length | 270–300 seconds (5 min) |
| Cast | 1–2 (dialogue recommended) |
| Entity count | 4–8 |
| Time shifts | 1–2 |
| Inference load | high (recoverable from context) |
| Clause depth | dense (but parseable) |
| Lexical rarity | advanced (avoid niche jargon) |
| Discourse markers | rich |
| Audio speed | 150–175 wpm |
| Sentence pauses | 200–400 ms |
| Chunk duration | 12–18 seconds |
| Discourse shape | tradeoff or implicit_stance |

## Questions

- **Count**: 5–6
- **Distribution**: Pragmatic-heavy, with supporting literal and relational

### Patterns
```
✓ "What is the speaker really asking for?"
✓ "Which part contains indirect criticism?"
✓ "What assumption is being made?"
✓ "How would you rephrase this more diplomatically?"
✓ "How would you rephrase this more directly?"
✓ "What is left unsaid but clearly intended?"
```

## Story Crafting

### Language
- Advanced vocabulary (sophisticated, not obscure)
- Natural idioms and collocations
- Full command of tense and aspect
- Subtle modal distinctions: would have, might have, could have been
- Nominalizations and formal register
- Hedging and distancing language

### Structure
- Tradeoff or implicit stance narratives
- Multiple perspectives with unstated conclusions
- Subtext and reading between the lines
- Diplomatic disagreement and face-saving
- Complex topics with nuanced positions

### Implicit Stance Narrative
Three layers to decode:
1. **Surface**: What is literally said
2. **Subtext**: What is actually meant
3. **Stance**: Speaker's real position

### Discourse Markers
- Attitude: frankly, admittedly, interestingly
- Concessive: nevertheless, be that as it may, granted
- Reformulation: in other words, that is to say
- Stance: to be fair, if I'm honest, arguably

### Diplomacy Patterns
**Softening criticism:**
- "That's an interesting approach, though I wonder if..."
- "I see what you're trying to do, but have you considered..."

**Indirect requests:**
- "I don't suppose you could..."
- "I was hoping we might..."

**Face-saving:**
- Offering alternatives rather than rejection
- Passive to avoid blame
- Hedging with "perhaps", "possibly"

## Complexity Requirements

Stories should have:
- Multiple valid interpretations of intent
- Unstated conclusions to infer
- Competing perspectives without clear "right answer"
- Register shifts within conversation

---

## Red Flags (Never Use)

- ❌ Niche jargon requiring specialist knowledge
- ❌ Obscure idioms
- ❌ Unrecoverable inference
- ❌ More than 2 speakers
- ❌ Deep cultural or regional knowledge required
- ❌ Sentences requiring re-reading (this is listening)
